# Covid-19-Case-Predictions-

This study will experiment on the Covid-19 data for each 50 states in the United States taken from the Covid Tracking Project. It will be utilizing polynomial regression as the mathematical algorithm to predict future cases, calculate the probability of infection from the data, and model the regression plots accordingly.
<br />
The purpose of this study is to present an approach to forecasting Covid-19 using a mathematical algorithm to provide information about the subject.
